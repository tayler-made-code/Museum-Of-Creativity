## Description

Hey there!  We're a group of three full-stack students at Atlas School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We're passionate about bringing ideas to life through the magic of code. 

### A Collaborative Masterpiece: A Story of Seamless Synergy

This project was a testament to the power of teamwork. While learning three.js might have presented some initial challenges (sorry, Aaron!), we embraced our individual strengths. Each of us played a specific role:

Sarah Markland: Sarah spearheaded the overall vision and architecture of the Museum, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly experience.

Tayler Coon: Tayler brought the exhibits to life with a smooth, interactive Swiper Carousel, allowing visitors to effortlessly browse the Museum's wonders.

Aaron Bell: Aaron bravely ventured into the realm of three.js, crafting a captivating virtual forest exhibit that immerses visitors in a world of digital nature.

By meticulously planning and communicating, we avoided merge conflicts and ensured every contribution seamlessly blended into the final masterpiece. The result? A whimsically playful museum that celebrates the boundless power of imagination.
